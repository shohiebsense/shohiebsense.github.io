It is a strange, unsurprising phenomenon of layoffs nowadays, as far as I know, it was from September last year up to this day.

All the new annual trending, for now, is ChatGPT, and you think, is it the cause?

Not really. IT Industries since 2018 I would say, on making their product are too much emphasizing the leverage aspect of it. $$$ and all the crap.

They are overconfident, just making a small niche would hit the market.

Yes about business failure failure success jargon, however, you are just too much man, 

what do you care the most about, honestly, the product or just the idea of you, or even just yourself? 

Say Tesla, is now one of the EV leaders. What do you assume about what they thought in the first place? Is it money? 

No way man,

It's the novelty itself, they think about usability. And how purposeful for people. The novelty is that as close to humanity as possible.

Ok next Tiktok. what does it do? To reach more audiences than the existing social media. Providing better engagement than the current ads. 

Lesson learned buddy.

Jangan sampai lupa daratan.

Money never brings you up to be a winner. I talk about sustainability.

In the end, you decide.
