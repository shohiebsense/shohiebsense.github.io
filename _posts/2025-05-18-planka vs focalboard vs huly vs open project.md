Planka arguably is the thing that I want so far.  

Focalboard is number two, but alas, from the repo it says they stop the maintenance.  

Open Project is ok, apart from they provide in `app purchases`, divided by features. but I get it i need money too to keep my life running.  

Huly, it's good, it's so good even, it just I don't need those gigantic features, I just want to have a straight forward project management, collaboration tools, focused on the project, that's it.
