Suppose we have data number of correct answers and the attitude mark like this


| # Correct (x) | Attiitude (y) |
| --- | --- |
| 17 | 94 |
| 13 | 73 |
| 12 | 59 |
| 15 | 80 |
| 16 | 93 |
| 14 | 85 |
| 16 | 66 |
| 16 | 79 |
| 18 | 77 |
| 19 | 91 |  

Using linear regression, find the Attitude mark if the correct answer is 15  

Steps:  

(1) Find the a, which is Y-Intercept of Regression Line

a = mean(y) - b * mean(x)  

(2) Find the b, which isi slope of regression line  

b = r * Sy / Sx

(3) Work with the Linear Regression Function

y = a + bx
