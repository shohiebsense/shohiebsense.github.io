Suppose we have data number of correct answers and the attitude mark like this


| # Correct (x) | Attiitude (y) |
| --- | --- |
| 17 | 94 |
| 13 | 73 |
| 12 | 59 |
| 15 | 80 |
| 16 | 93 |
| 14 | 85 |
| 16 | 66 |
| 16 | 79 |
| 18 | 77 |
| 19 | 91 |  

Using linear regression, find the Attitude mark if the correct answer is 15  

Steps:  

(1) Find the a, which is Y-Intercept of Regression Line.

a = mean(y) - b * mean(x)  

Y-intercept is where you draw the lines between the point of slope to the y-axis 

x is an independent variable.  

the mean average of x is 17 + 13 + 12 + 15 + 16 + 14 + 16 + 16 + 18 + 19 = 156 / 10 = **15.6**  

the mean average of y ix 94 + 73 + 59 + 80 + 93 + 85 + 66 + 79 + 77 + 91 = 797 / 10 = **79.7**  


(2) Find the b, which isi slope of regression line  

b = r * Sy / Sx

r is Pearson correlation coefficient  
Sy is the standard deviation of y  
Sx is the standard deviation of x  

(3) Find the r, Pearson correlation coefficient  



(3) Work with the Linear Regression Function

y = a + bx
