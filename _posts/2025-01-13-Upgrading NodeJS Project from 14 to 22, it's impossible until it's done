I thought it was only a fairy tale.  

Because doing it would not be worth my soul.  

I feel anger or disappointed mix or whatever.  

To this day I write this post, I saw this [https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/1ff1rff/upgrade_web_app_from_node_version_14x_to_20x/](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/1ff1rff/upgrade_web_app_from_node_version_14x_to_20x/)  

So yeah the idea is to upgrade the node incrementally from 14 to 18 then 20 and 22.  

The project is NodeJS, so many scoped packages library. `@nestjs/xxx`  

I did it and it feels good. Only to realize the world doesn't allow me to feel so.  

The power dynamics are one of the factors.  

So I would say it felt good I know, just to know it, it is possible.  

only to feel eventual distasteful afterwards.  

Overall no regrets. again, It's cool that I have done it.
