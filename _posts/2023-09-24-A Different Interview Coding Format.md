I believe Indonesian devs have something to improve on communication.

While the coding tests and appraisals have narrow dimensions.

The advantages are there defo, you can see how well one can handle the pressure, have the domain knowledge over the world problems, experience.

So It mostly has something to do with remembering or experiencing problems that you faced before.

There is still room that has to be covered.

The ability to explain, and being in a team, how you collaborate.

We know those coding problems exist when we search on the internet.

So instead, I would allow the candidate to search the problems and solutions, just give em about 5 - 7 minutes to solve, depending on the complexity.

And explain to me how your code works, and your thought process.
