1. Modernization with containers and serverless technologies

Background: App we build need to scale quickly. to million of users, global availability, respond in milisecondds, handle petabytes of data.  

Modern applicatiion characteristics: Modular architectural patterns, as serverless as possible, agile development process; innovate faster and reducing risk time to market, and cost of ownership.  

what it means to be modular archictural patterns: the application decomposed into a number of smaller, independent component and loosely coupled microservices, each with its own dedicated data store.  

In microservices, services are typically built around business capabilities, independently deployable by fully deployment and machinery.  

diifferent services in a given application may actually be written in different programming languages, thus may also be usiing different data storage technologies.  

Benefits: Separating monolith into these smaller components makes it faster to release cadence, sdlc automation,
