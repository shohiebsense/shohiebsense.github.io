You can go ahead with its documentation or everything, even straight with chatgpt if you fulfill these:

- You know the fact that pods can run numerous containers
- You know kubernetes can be installed through Docker Desktop or Docker Toolbox (MiniKube) or MicroK8S
- For convenience make sure the kubectl is installed
- If you decide to install through MicroK8s, use snap (rather than apt or yum)
- Read the kubernetes terminologies like Pod, Controller, Service, Namespace, Node, Kubelet, Control Plane
- You have to know the way kubernetes load the docker image.
- You have to know the purpose of dockerhub, and eventually your docker registry url
- If you decide not to push the docker image to private registry, then you make your own registry container
- Make sure you pushed your image to docker registry url: `docker tag experimental-service-alpha localhost:5000/experimental-service-alpha` -> `docker push localhost:5000/experimental-service-alpha`
- Your pods at least can have status `ContainerCreating`, `ImagePullBackOff`, `ErrImagePull`, and `Running`
- Common reason that you have status other than Running is that Kubernetes didnt find the image, you have to push first.
