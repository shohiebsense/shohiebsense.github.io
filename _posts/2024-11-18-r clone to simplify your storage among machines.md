Was introduced by Ikwan my colleague. 

Have a look to it [https://rclone.org/downloads/](https://rclone.org/downloads/)  

or use brew [https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/rclone](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/rclone)  

ChatGPT knows it too, so it is convenient  

```
1. Follow the prompts:

    Select New remote.
    Give it a name (e.g., myserver).
    Choose the type of storage: sftp.
    Enter the required details such as:
        Host (IP or domain of the remote server),
        Username (SSH username),
        Port (default is 22 for SSH),
        Path to the SSH key (if you're using key-based authentication).

Example:

Enter a name for the remote: myserver
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value: sftp
SSH Host: my.remote.server
User: username
SSH Port (leave blank to use default): 22
Path to SSH key file (leave blank to use password): /path/to/ssh/key

Test the connection when prompted.

2. Sync Large Files

To sync large files between your local machine and the remote server, use the following commands:

    Upload files from local to remote:

rclone sync /path/to/local/dir myserver:/path/to/remote/dir

Download files from remote to local:

    rclone sync myserver:/path/to/remote/dir /path/to/local/dir

The sync command ensures that the destination matches the source by deleting any extra files in the destination that are not in the source. If you donâ€™t want this behavior, use copy instead.

```


Resume Interrupted Transfers

Rclone automatically resumes interrupted transfers, making it ideal for large files.
