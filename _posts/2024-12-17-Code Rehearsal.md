It's like when youb are a band member/singer/musician.  

The goal of rehearsal
```
is to practice and better the performance of your songs as a band, so work hard to keep out any distractions
```

replace the `band` to `code`  

So the activity is that we explain things what we've been writing so far.  

Or the modules/functionalities that we work on.  

Use or ask your team members just to listen and ask for feedback.  

do it in live, you explain verbally or you open the session.

So you can have advantage to both.  

The code quality instead of just relying on Pull Requests + Reviews + Code Quality Check like sonar.  

You add more layer just adding this code rehearsal session.
