1. Software Development should keep 'secure' in mind from the start and throught SDLC process.
2. Be careful during code Reviews (access modifiers), Third party libraries usage, or modules that are developed by third-party vendors.
3. Make some technical standards, coding guidelines, and reference frameworks (find out if the third party libraaries have any issues with security vulnerabilities).
4. Things to do: Code Review, Architecture Risk Analysis, Pentests, Risk-based seecurity testing (reviewing the security of all functions), abuse cases, fraud detection, security incident response.
5. Use automated code review to reduce time-consumption.
6. Code reviews to read subtle issues.
7. Benefit of executing security assesments will be cheaper if it's done during early stage of SDLC.
