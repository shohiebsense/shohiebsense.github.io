We have already seen improvement in Android Studio from time to time. Canary was a nightmare, but I think this Electric Eel is overall fine.

I was trying to use the latest possible Xcode version that the Ventura 13.1 can get.  

However I came across bugs, let alone the laggy. Every Simulator has a black screen. The preview (content view) also failed to display.  

I tried to downgrade the version. now using 14.1, works well.  

So, try to do it if you happen to face a similar problem.
