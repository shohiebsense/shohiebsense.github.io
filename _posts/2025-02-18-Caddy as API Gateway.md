am thinking of substituting krakend with caddy.  

rate limiting can be controlled in an actual app/service.  

While in practical real life world not so much happening other than rerouting.  

The fact that you define the configuraton easier with caddy, for rerouting can also work with its `rewrite`.  

I tried it and it works well so far, but haven't tried the specific, edge cases yet.
