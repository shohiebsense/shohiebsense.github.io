The stackoverflow answers mostly are about preferences, substituting one widget for another that is appealing.  

The thing is you have to know what you want to make. Does it require a specific size? Or does it needs flexibility?  

How do you attach them to the screen? Will it be full, and fit the screen? Or Is scrollable ok?  

You have to keep in mind the rules and constraints too.ã€€You cannot easily mix the Flexible widgets with the Size-required widgets, Expanded with SizedBox for example, you have to make a certain approach.

Also, LayoutBuilder is useful. Just take this [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-animated-responsive-layout#0)  

[This article](https://blog.codemagic.io/building-responsive-applications-with-flutter/) is useful too. 

In other words, it requires experience and aptitude.
