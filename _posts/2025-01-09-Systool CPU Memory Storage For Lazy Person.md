I know it's innovative and groundbreaking when it comes to Grafana x Prometheus x Node Exporter and so on.  

But have you ever wondered is there something simpler than that. I just want to monitor and that's that.  

Tried not a few:
[https://github.com/google/cadvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)  
[https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun)  
[https://github.com/opinkerfi/adagios](https://github.com/opinkerfi/adagios)  
Even there's a curated list of it [https://github.com/awesome-foss/awesome-sysadmin#monitoring](https://github.com/awesome-foss/awesome-sysadmin#monitoring)  
I might like this [https://github.com/dani3l0/Status](https://github.com/dani3l0/Status)  
NetData is worth to try [https://github.com/netdata/community](https://github.com/netdata/community)  
This is top [https://github.com/jhuckaby/performa](https://github.com/jhuckaby/performa)  
Unfortunattely that one uses NodeJS, when it comes to read the hardware level, the garbage collections behavior apparent. So it displays not exactly as accurate.  




For some while  

I find [https://github.com/shohiebsense/StatSniper](https://github.com/shohiebsense/StatSniper)  

It uses Go and Js as a frontend. I forked from [https://github.com/StatSniper/StatSniper](https://github.com/StatSniper/StatSniper)  

I know it's not the best way to utilize loop http request. However you can start from there to improve and enhance it.  Streamline or sockets whatever.
