1. It's verbose but shorter, or simpler with kotlin
2. Relies on annotation. It feels weird, but that's the magic works. Let it cook.
3. The configurations represented by `.yml`, `.properties` (gradle / groovy),  `.xml`, `.graphqls` located in `project/src/main/resources/`
4. `test-resources` sometimes helpful, sometimes not.
5. Compile time I think slightly below golang, even with rust i think kotlin are on par with rust.
6. Should be powerful when scaling, but in terms of productivity golang still on top.
7. Me Ok, 8/10. The defining factor is that the debug/log message. Easier to understand. As for comparison, I think nodejs is hellish.
