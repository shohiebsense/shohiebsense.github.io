It was fun to begin with I know. Like you can do it and enjoy it for hours.

Now money comes in, and other people or parties have some involvement with your work. Things get demanding, and more rapid but less satisfactory.

The options are, you choose to lament or you choose to struggle. Your work is indeed already quite a mess tho, isnt it.

My piece of advice besides the better ones is, to think, em not only to think really, but you have to treat, to act, about the work you do 
as a form of worship to Allah. After that do it in moderation. Be present, and do it effectively. When you are at the right timing, do it at that moment.
