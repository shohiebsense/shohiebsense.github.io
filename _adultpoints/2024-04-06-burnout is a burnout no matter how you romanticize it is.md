It was fun to begin with I know. You can do it and enjoy it for hours.

Now money comes in, and other people or parties have some involvement with your work. Things get demanding, and more rapid but less satisfactory.

The options are, you choose to lament or you choose to struggle. Your work is indeed already quite a mess tho, isn't it.

My piece of advice besides the better ones is, to think, em not only to think really, but you have to treat, to act, about the work you do 
as a form of worship to Allah. As cheesy, cringe as it sounds, it is a fact that by Allah's mercy, you have a chance to work, you are given healthy conditions to do the work, and so many. So it will be easy for you if you have any difficulties, you can ask Allah to seek refuge, to ease. Because it is by Allah's mercy too that you ended up in the situation you are currently in, to be this way. No matter how you can manipulate the situation, in the end, we exist to worship Allah, other people are there in the presence of us to get to know one another.

After that do it in moderation. Be present, and do it effectively. When you are at the right time, do it at that moment. 

as I am currently on sick, I have watched The Aquatope on White Sand. I intended to watch it to relax, enjoy, and appreciate the great graphics and animations. I just have to accept nowadays working in the IT industry, at this current pace being sick is now a privilege
